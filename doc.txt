#in my case we have variety of works

***Backlog:(agile methodology, proejct Management, stakeholder Management)
***Backlog is a popular term when it is come up with agile way

1. new Order :
  ---place new Order
  ---Support payment through a chatbot
  
2. Track Order :
 ---Track order by order id
 --- Track order by phone number 
 --- Track order by customer

3. Offers/Store Hours
  ---Ongoing offers 
  --- Upcoming offers
  --- Stores hours

  
***This is import for the product build
(Feasibility impact analysis)
  -->Goal is to build high Feasibility and high impact of the product

***Then discussion about MVP(minimum Viable Product) and its 
features and you can use tools such as jira, notion, asana etc
(those tools manage in Management project, backlog etc)
--in this case of MVP , you can start with 
--i)place new order
--ii) Track order by order id 

***Now think about Solution Design and Architecture when 
--- you have a scope of a works(sow) clearly define so far that 
***I want to build a chatbot put it on my website chatbot should 
---support of those two features



****prompt for chatbot build***
" I have a fast food business for which I want to build a chatbot
--that will place on my website. Through this chatbot a user will be 
--able to place a food order.
---How should I implement this ?Give me some suggestions along with tools
--that I can use . I am looking for effective solution with very less 
--learning curve.

---I have a mysql database to save orders etc. I want to main 
--features(1) .New Order (2) Track Order in my chatbot."



***another prompt***
---Can you tell me the step by step processs to implement this in dialogeflow

*************************
---Building a Chatbit step by step ----
   --Description: I am going to a chatbot in dialogeflow for a food delivery
   --system. It will be an end-to-end project covering Dialogflow basics, 
   --building a backend in python and Fastapi , interactions with mysql database,
   --and much more. We will cover Dialogflow fundamentals such as 
   --intents, entities, context, etc.

-
1.First thing we define scope of work (SOW) 
---new order, track order, billing queries, store hours

2.--Chatbot platform---
  --for this we can use Dialogflow, or Rasa or Amazon Lex 
  --Among of these , I prefer using Dialogflow due to this project suit 

3.Dialogflow setup , Define intents, context & fulfillment
  --intents: "new order", "order add", "order remove", "track order"
  --fulfillment: Create a webhook that can connect to a backend to 
  --create new order and track existing orders 

4. Build Backend: A backend that is connedted to our answers database
  --and framwork like Fastapi/Flask/Django/Node.js




******As platform selection I choose dialogeflow for this poject 
    ---which is more suitable in this solution because it offers
    --powerful NLP capabilities out of the box.
    --It relies Google's vast training database
    --It gives cloud based solution
    --Limited customized option but provides easy integrations
    --with various platform and channels

***Dialogflow setup 17:32 min start 

###please go to this url
  ---https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow?hl=en
  ---https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/login

  ---NB: Dialogflow ES would be a suitable choice for building 
  ---a chatbot for online food delivery with two options: "New Order"
  , Track Order" (Because cost, Agent Structure, Integration Channel, Basic Analysis is 
  --- is better service)

****The intent is a mapping between what the user says and the action
  ---that will be taken by a chatbot or your backend.

  ==>Entities (when intent call in the backend then get 
  the information throuh entities such three pizza'a which entities)

  --Example: user: what would you like to order?
            Bot: Hey, I want 2 (2 in entities) pav Bhaji and one pizza
  
  ---Micheal Bloomberge founded Bloomberge. here Micheal is person
  ---entities and Bloomberge is a company entities .
  ***Dialogflow uses some techniques using recognize some entities.

   ***From the chat conversation you can extract two things
      ---1. Entities nothing but the argument to the python function.
       2.Intent (Intent is mapped to some python functions )
       
       ---Example: Bot: I want "new order" or "track order"?
               user: Can you track my order" Intent : truck order 

               def track_order(order_id, int):
                   //implementation
                track_order(9922)
